## The Best IA for a Power 4 

Creation of an artificial intelligence in Python to play the power 4 game.

In order to reduce the calculation time of our algo, without impacting too much its performance, we have created a specific method. This one will decrease the rank according to the phase of the game. For example, during the first rounds, we will calculate only 4 moves in advance, because the result is generally the same whatever the initial rank value chosen. Also at the end of the game, if the AI has only 2 tokens left, it will not bother to calculate the possibilities at a rank of 7.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the programm you need to have Python on your machine.
